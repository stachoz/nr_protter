nrPlotter is a cross-platform C++ application for students to complete tasks related to numerical recipes classes.

## Dependencies

This project uses CMake's FetchContent module to download and configure all required libraries automatically. You do not need to install any of them manually.

    CMake (>= 3.12): The build system generator used to configure and build the project.

    GLFW: A multi-platform library used for creating the window, handling the OpenGL context, and receiving keyboard/mouse input.

    GLAD: An OpenGL Loading Library that generates the code needed to use modern OpenGL functions.

    pbPlots: A simple C++ library used to generate the plot data and render it to a PNG image.

    stb_image: A single-header C library for loading the generated PNG image as a texture in OpenGL.

    CLI11: A powerful, modern, and header-only C++ library used for parsing all command-line arguments.

## Installation and Build

Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed on your system before proceeding.
Prerequisites

    Git: For cloning the repository.

    CMake (version 3.12 or newer): For configuring the build.

    A C++17 compliant compiler:

        Linux: g++ or clang++ (install with sudo apt-get install build-essential).

        macOS: Apple Clang (install with xcode-select --install).

        Windows: Visual Studio 2019 or newer (with the "Desktop development with C++" workload).

Build Steps

**1. Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal or command prompt and clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/SWENG-UKSW/nr_protter.git
cd nr_protter
```

**2. Configure the Build with CMake**

Create a build directory and run CMake from within it. This step will automatically fetch all dependencies.
Generated bash

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

**Note:** The first time you run `cmake ..`, it may take a moment as it downloads the required libraries. Subsequent runs will be instantaneous.

**3. Compile the Project**

Once configuration is complete, build the executable.

```
cmake --build .
```

The compiled executable (nrPlotter or nrPlotter.exe) will be located inside the build directory.
Features


## Interaction

The application supports several modes of interaction for generating and manipulating plots. Key	Action:

| Key | Action                                                                |
|:----|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`a`** | **Plot from Function:** Generates a new plot from a pre-defined mathematical function (e.g., sine wave). |
| **`s`** | **Plot Hardcoded Data:** Generates a plot from a hardcoded set of `(x,y)` data points. |
| **`d`** | **Plot from Clicks:** Generates a new plot using the coordinates of all the points the user has added by clicking on the window. |
| **`x`** | **Collect X-Range:** Enters a mode where the next two mouse clicks define the minimum and maximum X-axis range for future plots. |
| **`y`** | **Collect Y-Range:** Enters a mode where the next two mouse clicks define the minimum and maximum Y-axis range for future plots. |
| **`c`** | **Clear User Input:** Clears all stored mouse clicks and resets the custom X/Y ranges. |
| **`ESC`**| **Exit:** Closes the application.      



## Command-Line Options

The plot dimensions and viewing ranges can be configured at launch using the following options.
Option	Long Option	Description:

      
| Option | Long Option     | Description                                     |
|:-------|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| **`-x`** | `--plot-width`  | Sets the plot width in pixels.                  |
| **`-y`** | `--plot-height` | Sets the plot height in pixels.                 |
| **`-a`** | `--pad-width`   | Sets the plot padding width in pixels.          |
| **`-s`** | `--pad-height`  | Sets the plot padding height in pixels.         |
| **`-z`** | `--range-minx`  | Sets the minimum value of the X-axis.           |
| **`-c`** | `--range-maxx`  | Sets the maximum value of the X-axis.           |
| **`-t`** | `--range-miny`  | Sets the minimum value of the Y-axis.           |
| **`-u`** | `--range-maxy`  | Sets the maximum value of the Y-axis.           |
| **`-h`** | `--help`        | Displays the help message with all available options. |

    
## Example Usage

To run the application and generate a plot of size 1280x720 with a specific X-axis range:

```
./nrPlotter --plot-width 1280 --plot-height 720 --range-minx -7.0 --range-maxx 13.0
```
